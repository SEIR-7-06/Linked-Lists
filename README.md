# Linked Lists

Linked lists are a foundational data structure that many other, more complex structures use as their basis. 

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:
- Define a linked list.
- Explain how a node stores data. 
- Identify situations where you use a linked list instead of an array.
- Build a singly linked list.

## Prerequisites
* Big O Notation
* myGA module: [Linked Lists](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/397)

## Additional Resources
- The top 20 [linked list interview questions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-20-linked-list-interview-question/) (that's a LOT!).
- Visualize [building a linked list](https://visualgo.net/bn/list).
- Learn more about [doubly linked lists](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms/tree/master/src/data-structures/doubly-linked-list) (we only cover a singly linked list in the exercise).
